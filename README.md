A pratical project from the course Software Engineering 1 at the university of Vienna. 

The project contains 2 parts - a client and a server.

The server handles only a subset of the functionality needed to handle all client requests (the course provided a fully functional server implementation). The clients however cover all aspects. 

The main idea of the game is to start 2 clients - both of them register to the same game, send a half map each and then traversing the map from a starting point i.e a castle to find their hidden treasure respectively.
After doing so the client should find the enemy castle. This leads to a win. Of course there're different constraints like 10 minutes maximum and so on.
